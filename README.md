## Description

Submission for Module 2 of the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development &amp; UX

This assignment took a starter code package in commit [663bfc4](https://github.com/Stefan4D/uob-module-02-challenge/tree/663bfc4dbe755b36418ec08640f8e3e3091fab22) and developed it to meet the defined acceptance criteria.

The production website is deployed [here](https://stefan4d.github.io/uob-module-02-challenge/).

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you | Name included in h1 element <br /> Avatar included <br /> Links to section about me, my portfolio, and how to contact included <br /> Note: content is placeholder to protect privacy. |
| When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section                                               | When links are clicked, user is taken to the associated section on the page.                                                                                                           |
| When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications                                             | Evidence 3                                                                                                                                                                             |
| When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others                             | Evidence 4                                                                                                                                                                             |
| When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application                                                   | Evidence 5                                                                                                                                                                             |
| When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport                         | Media queries have been used to adjust the page layout with breakpoints at widths of 1024px and 768px.                                                                                 |

## Learning Outcome

I used a combindation of resources in completing this challenge assignment, including taking different fragments of code and combining them to come up with a solution specific to my problem-- making the portfolio cards clickable as a link whilst maintaining accessibility for the anchor tags.

I have learned how to apply styles in layers in order to achieve a desired effect, and also the need to tidy up styles as my codebase evolves so as to remove any potential conflicts with other styles.

## Resources Used

In completing this challenge exercise, I made use of the following resources:

- [Stack Overflow: Make a div into a link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/796087/make-a-div-into-a-link)
- [Stack Overflow: Using bootstrap cards as a hyperlink](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49554070/using-bootstrap-cards-as-a-hyperlink)
